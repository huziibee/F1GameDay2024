 - is a common class that is to be used to load Json Data
 - pass position data or any other json data from the rest api service

1) As the video buffer is progressing or seeked to a different position, the global timestamp is changed.
2) On event global timestamp changed, the components will fetch the data for the next 6 seconds beginning at the stored timestamp to next 6 seconds from the 
data service and store it in-memory. 
3) Each component keeps track of data being displayed. 
4) As the seek pointer comes closer to the end of the buffer, data is fetched again from the data service into the next page. 
5) When it's the end, the data is cleared from page 1 and Page 2 becomes main page.

tempPage = mainPage;
mainPage = secondPage;
secondPage = tempPage;
